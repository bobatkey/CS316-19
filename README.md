# CS316 Functional Programming 2019/2020

Welcome to the page for the University of Strathclyde's “Functional Programming” class (CS316).

This course has a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/StrathCS316).

*Assessment:* this course is entirely assessed by coursework. There are three exercises that you will complete (details below). You will do roughly 60% of the exercise at home or in the labs, and the 40% is done in exam conditions in the lab.

See the [schedule](schedule.txt).

## Contact

The course lecturer is **Bob Atkey**. Office LT1305 [robert.atkey@strath.ac.uk](mailto:robert.atkey@strath.ac.uk).

## Lectures

Lectures are at **13:00 Tuesdays** in JA501 and **11am Fridays** in RC447.

Most of the lectures involve me doing live coding with explanations of what I am doing. This repository contains cleaned up versions of the live coding, interspersed with commentary.
